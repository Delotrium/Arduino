# Description
This code is a program that can be used as a life jacket. The code takes the input of the light using a photoresistor. When the value of the photoresistor is below the threshold a
LED will strobe (simulating a night environment where the LED is used so others can locate the life-jacket), but while the value is above the threshold the buzzer will turn on, as the light 
will not need to be on (simulating a day envirnment where the light cannot be used).
